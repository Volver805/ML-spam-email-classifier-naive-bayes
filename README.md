# ML-spam-email-classifier-naive-bayes

### Introduction
Spam Email detector to detect spam emails by using the naive bayes multinomial algorithm.

### Algorithm
We are using naive bayes algorithm which classifies data (emails) into two classes (Spam, Ham) it is implemented using MultinomialNB module imported from sklearn libirary.

### Setup
#### Classifier
```
  pip install -r requirements.txt
  python Classifier.py
```
#### Spam predictor
```
  pip install -r requirements.txt
  python -m run flask
```
